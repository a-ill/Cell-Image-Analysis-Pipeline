# Cell-Image-Analysis-Pipeline
This repository contains a neural network trained on yeast images and capable of detecting cells and their vacuoles. Scripts for training the neural network and analyse the output are also available.

### Usage
1. Run "training.m" to train the supplied neural network on your data.

2. Run "analysis1.m" to detect yeast cells and their vacuoles.

3. Run "analysis2.m" to get cell and vacuole volume data.
